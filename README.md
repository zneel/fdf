## üìç Overview

The project is a 3D wireframe projection viewer called "fdf" that uses the mlx graphics library. Its core functionalities include loading and parsing map files, rendering 3D wireframe projections of terrains, and allowing users to interact with the projections through keyboard inputs. The project's purpose is to provide a visually appealing and interactive way to view and explore terrain maps, which can be useful for various applications such as geographical analysis, game development, and virtual reality simulations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular design pattern with separate files for different functionalities such as event handling, parsing, drawing, and matrix operations. It uses a graphics library called mlx and a custom library called libft for additional functionality in handling graphics and data structures. The main.c file serves as the entry point for the application and initializes the necessary components. Overall, the architecture seems well-structured and organized.    |
| **üìñ Documentation**   | The codebase has a limited amount of documentation. While some individual functions and files are documented, the overall documentation is not comprehensive. There could be more detailed explanations of the system's components, their interdependencies, and usage instructions. Properly documenting the codebase would enhance its maintenance, understanding, and extendibility.    |
| **üîó Dependencies**    | The codebase relies on two external libraries: mlx for graphical operations and libft for additional functionality. mlx is a library specifically designed for graphics programming in C, while libft is a custom library providing implementations of various standard C library functions. The dependencies seem suitable for fulfilling the requirements of the project.   |
| **üß© Modularity**      | The codebase is divided into smaller, interchangeable components based on their functionalities. Each component has a specific purpose, such as event handling, parsing, drawing, and matrix operations. This modular approach allows for better organization, code reuse, and maintenance. However, there could be clearer separation between some of the components and better-defined interfaces between them.    |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**          | The codebase does not include any explicit testing strategies or tools. There are no dedicated test files or frameworks mentioned to validate the functionality of the components. Having comprehensive tests would enhance the reliability and robustness of the system, ensuring that it performs as expected in different scenarios.     |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**      | Given the complexity of rendering and manipulating 3D wireframe models, the codebase performs reasonably well. However, without detailed performance profiling or benchmarks, it is difficult to assess its exact performance characteristics. It would be beneficial to optimize specific sections like drawing and rendering to improve speed, efficiency, and resource usage.   |
| **üîê Security**        | The codebase does not have explicit measures mentioned for security. Considering that it is an open-source project, developers should be cautious about handling user input, especially when reading map files. Potential vulnerabilities like buffer overflow, input validation, and memory allocation should be carefully addressed to ensure data integrity and system stability.   |
| **üîÄ Version Control** | The codebase adopts Git for version control. It is stored in a Git repository hosted on GitHub. Utilizing version control allows multiple contributors to collaborate, track changes, and roll back if necessary, minimizing conflicts and ensuring code integrity. Regular commit practices, branching, and proper documentation of changes can further enhance the version control process.    |
| **üîå Integrations**    | The codebase primarily interacts with external libraries, mlx and libft, to achieve desired functionalities. As it stands, there are no explicit integrations with external systems or services mentioned. However, being open-source, it

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the project repository. This creates a copy of the project on your account that you can modify without affecting the original project.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using a Git client like Git or GitHub Desktop.
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `new-feature-branch` or `bugfix-issue-123`).
```sh
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
```
4. Make changes to the project's codebase.
5. Commit your changes to your local branch with a clear commit message that explains the changes you've made.
```sh
git commit -m 'Implemented new feature.'
```
6. Push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command
```sh
git push origin new-feature-branch
```
